\label{Evaluation}

In this section, we first conduct experiments and confirm our basic analysis.
Then we evaluate the algorithms in large-scale networks by simulations.



\subsection{Experiments for Fundamental Observation}


In our experiment, we implemented $16$ EZ$240$ sensors, each of which uses $8$MHz MSP$430$F$1611$ 
as the microprocessor and is equipped with $10$K RAM, 
$48$K ROM and $1$ M Flash. CC$2420$ is used as the communication 
module with the IEEE $802.15.4$ protocol. RTIMER\_ARCH\_CECOND is the clock frequency 
and a time slot is set as 500/RTIMER\_ARCH\_CECOND,
which is around $0.5$ms in the real world. As discussed in section \ref{RW}, the time slot of beacon-based 
algorithms, e.g. searchlight~\cite{bakht2012searchlight}, is set as $20$ms.
We can see from the APIs in MAC layer that CSMA mechanism makes the process to wait a random time 
when a collision happens, which implies collisions result in a high latency.

\end{table}

We compared Alano with Searchlight~\cite{bakht2012searchlight}, Hedis~\cite{chen2015heterogeneous}
and ALOHA~\cite{you2011aloha} in the experiment. We can see the result from the Table \ref{Exp} that Alano outperforms the other algorithms.
Hedis shows low latency as well since it has an ideal latency bound for two nodes, 
and in a small-scale network its weakness of handling collisions is not obvious. 
Searchlight is a typical beacon-based algorithm with larger time slot, which results in high latency.
ALOHA is designed for a clique network and the probability adopted is not optimal.


\subsection{Simulations for Large-scale Networks}


To simulate a large-scale network, we implemented Alano in C++ and evaluated the algorithms in a cluster of 9 servers,
each equipped with an Intel Xeon 2.6GHz CPU with 24 hyper-threading cores, 64GB memory and 1T SSD.

We simulated a network that follows uniform distribution and Gaussian distribution respectively.
For uniform distribution, we suppose $500$ nodes are distributed in an area of $100m \times 100m$ 
and each node's communication range is $\Delta = 10m$. For Gaussian distribution, we suppose 
$1000$ nodes are distributed in the same area, but each node's communication range is $\Delta = 5m$. 
We set the Gaussian distribution as $N(50,15^2)$ in our evaluation.
We set the duty cycle of a node to be $0.1$ for symmetric nodes; 
for asymmetric nodes, we set their duty cycle randomly from $0.05$ to $0.15$ with step $0.02$.
These settings make the network more complicated and realistic than that in
\cite{wang2015blinddate, sun2014hello, bakht2012searchlight,
chen2015heterogeneous, kandhalu2010u, you2011aloha,
mcglynn2001birthday, song2014probabilistic, vasudevan2009neighbor}.


We evaluated discovery latency of Alano, Aloha-like~\cite{you2011aloha}, Hello~\cite{sun2014hello}, Hedis~\cite{chen2015heterogeneous}, and Searchlight~\cite{bakht2012searchlight} in the generated networks. %Besides, we evaluated G-Nihao(we choose the best parameters, $m=n$, $\alpha=0.054$)~\cite{qiu2016talk}, but $500$ symmetric nodes in uniform distribution can only discover $2\%$ neighbors, which is worse than other $3$ deterministic algorithms we choose. Thus, we didn't show its result in our figures.
%Hedis only has two states $\{ON, OFF\}$ (representing the radio is on or off). To make the comparison more fair, we assume that when a node is in $\{ON\}$ state, it transmits or listens with equal probability $0.5$. 
Hello and Searchlight has a beacon transmission of $0.54ms$ at the beginning and end of each slot, and a beacon makes up about $1/40$ of a slot, so we divide each $\{ON\}$ slot into $40$ mini-slots, and the node transmits at the first and last mini-slot, and listens in other mini-slots.
In the following parts, we show that Alano has lower latency, higher discovery rate, and better scalability. %, and better robustness.




\subsubsection{Speed-Discovery Latency}

\subfigure[Gaussian Distribution]{\includegraphics[width=1.65in]{Figure/latency_normal}}

\label{fig_latency}
\end{figure}

When nodes follow uniform distribution, we show the discovery latency comparison for both symmetric nodes and asymmetric nodes in Fig. \ref{fig_latency}(a).
From the figure, Alano achieves $54.64\%$ to $1.95$ times lower discovery latency for symmetric nodes, and $85.25\%$ to $2.91$ times lower discovery latency for asymmetric nodes.
When nodes follow Gaussian distribution, as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig_latency}(b), 
Alano achieves $31.35\%$ to $1.21$ times lower discovery latency for symmetric nodes, 
and $45.94\%$ to $1.88$ times lower discovery latency for asymmetric nodes.
The deterministic algorithms, Hello, Hedis and Searchlight, have high latency due to either collisions or larger time slots. 


\subsubsection{Quality-Discovery Rate}

% \end{figure}


% Fig. \ref{fig_timerate} shows Alano with either global or local duty cycle, has higher discovery rate during the whole course of neighbor discovery in both uniform and normal distribution. The deterministic algorithms Hello, Hedis and Searchlight cannot discover all channels, because of the occurence of collisions. Aloha-like discovers more slowly than Alano when it has discovered a certain number of channels, such as $80\%$ channels in Uniform Distribution with Global Duty Cycle, because it is difficult for pure probabilistic algorithm to deal with the small amount of undiscovered neighbors.

% (??define discovery rate)
% (??some places you use normal distribution, but some places you use Gaussian distribution, correct them)
We use discovery rate to evaluate Alano's quality.
Discovery rate of a node $u_i$ is defined as the percentage of discovered neighbors over $u_i$'s all neighbors.
In Fig. \ref{fig_timerate_large}, we increase the number of nodes from $500$ to $1000$ for the uniform distribution, and increase the number of nodes from $1000$ to $2000$ for the Gaussian distribution, the results show that Alano has higher discovery rate during the whole process for both uniform and Gaussian distributions.

\subsubsection{Scalability-Duty Cycle and Network Density}

We evaluated Alano's scalability regarding duty cycle and network density.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\subfigure[Uniform Distribution]{\includegraphics[width=1.65in]{Figure/dutycycle_uniform}}
\hspace{0.01in}
\subfigure[Gaussian Distribution]{\includegraphics[width=1.65in]{Figure/dutycycle_normal}}
\caption{Alano achieves lower latency in different duty cycle.}
\label{fig_dutycycle}
\end{figure}


\emph{Duty Cycle.}
When symmetric nodes with different duty cycles, Fig. \ref{fig_dutycycle} shows that Alano has lower latency. Compared with Aloha, Alano has from $53.66\%$ to $11.23$ times lower latency. The latency of Alano and Aloha generally decreases as the duty cycle increases, while Hello, Hedis and Searchlight have high latency due to the collision. In Gaussian distribution, Alano has a small twist with duty cycle $0.35$, because when the duty cycle increases, nodes are more likely to transmit and therefore collide.


\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\subfigure[Uniform Distribution]{\includegraphics[width=1.65in]{Figure/node_uniform}}
\hspace{0.01in}
\subfigure[Gaussian Distribution]{\includegraphics[width=1.65in]{Figure/node_normal}}
\caption{Alano achieves lower latency with different number of nodes.}
\label{fig_node}
\end{figure}

\emph{Network Density.}
When the number of nodes increases, the network becomes denser. We choose Aloha-like algorithm for comparison because Hello, Hedis and Searchlight already have higher latency than Aloha-like when there are $500$ nodes in uniform distribution and $1000$ nodes in Gaussian distribution.
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig_node}(a), Alano achieves $4.68$ times to $6.51$ times lower discovery latency than Aloha-like algorithm for uniform distribution, when the number of nodes increases from $1000$ to $9000$.
When the number of nodes increases from $1000$ to $9000$ for Gaussian distribution, Alano achieves $25.23\%$ to $1.03$ times lower discovery latency as shown in Fig. \ref{fig_node}(b).  



% \subsection{Robustness}

% \begin{figure}[!h]
% \centering
% \subfigure[Uniform Distribution]{\includegraphics[width=1.65in]{Figure/robustU}}
% \hspace{0.01in}
% \subfigure[Gaussian Distribution]{\includegraphics[width=1.65in]{Figure/robustN}}
% \caption{Alano still reaches low latency when nodes die.}
% \label{fig_robust}
% \end{figure}

% In reality, a node may leave the network now and then (such as the node runs out of energy or the node is offline for other usage). We evaluate the robustness of the neighbor discovery algorithms in Fig. \ref{fig_robust}. When $5\%$ to $30\%$ nodes die (see x-axis of the figure), Alano still reaches low discovery latency for both uniform and Gaussian distributions. %(?? others?)
